3.1
===

Added ``wrap`` and ``unwrap`` functions and ``lorem_ipsum``
attribute containing the Lorem Ipsum sample text.

3.0.1
=====

Declare missing dependency on six.

3.0
===

Removed ``local_format``, ``global_format``, and
``namespace_format``. Instead, developers should
use `f-strings
<https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings>`_
on Python 3.6 and later or `future-fstrings
<https://pypi.org/project/future-fstrings>`_ for compatibilty
with older Pythons. This change eliminates the dependency on
jaraco.collections and thus for now removes the circular dependency
as reported in #3.

===

Switch to `pkgutil namespace technique
<https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#pkgutil-style-namespace-packages>`_
for the ``jaraco`` namespace.

In Stripper, always strip the prefix, even if it's empty.
